      <h2 class="text-3xl">MailPace Terms and Conditions of Use</h2>
      <h3 class="my-2 text-2xl">1. Terms</h3>

      <p class="my-2">
        By accessing this web site & application, you are agreeing to be bound by these
        Terms and Conditions of Use, all applicable laws and regulations,
        and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local
        laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from
        using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this web site are
        protected by applicable copyright and trade mark law.
      </p>

      <h3 class="my-2 text-2xl">2. MailPace Services</h3>
      <p class="my-2">2.1 Service Level Agreement. MailPace guarantees that the email API service and dashboard will be
        available 99% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding maintenance. You are entitled to a
        credit of 5% of your given monthly fee for the services for each 30 minutes of MailPace Service unavailability
        (after the first .01%) in a given monthly period.</p>
      <p class="my-2">2.2 Credit Limitations. You are not entitled to a credit if you are in breach of the terms
        governing your use of the services until you have cured the breach. You are not entitled to a credit if downtime
        would not have occurred but for your breach of these Terms of Service. You are not entitled to a credit for
        downtime or outages resulting from denial of service attacks, virus activity, hacking attempts, or any other
        circumstances that are not within our control. In addition, to receive a credit, you must request a credit by
        email MailPace's support team within thirty (30) days following the end of the downtime. You must show that your
        use of the services was adversely affected in some way as a result of the downtime to be eligible for the
        credit. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms of Service to the contrary, the maximum total credit for the
        monthly billing period, including all guaranties, shall not exceed 100% of the fees for that billing period.
        Credits that would be available but for this limitation will not be carried forward to future billing periods.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">2.3 Delivery. MailPace will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver your email messages,
        but MailPace does not guarantee delivery. Third party filtering services and other policies of recipient email
        services may prevent successful delivery of your messages</p>

      <h3 class="my-2 text-2xl">3. Customer Obligations</h3>
      <p class="my-2">3.1 Generally. You may use the services for commercial purposes of sending transactional email
        only and may not use the services in any situation where failure or fault of the services could lead to death or
        serious bodily injury of any person or physical or environmental damage, or to send any marketing emails. You
        agree that your use of any MailPace services will comply with the Acceptable Use Policy below. You agree that
        you are solely responsible for the suitability of the services and your compliance with any applicable laws,
        including export laws and data privacy laws.</p>
      <p class="my-2">3.2 Suspension of services. MailPace may suspend the services without liability if: (i) MailPace
        reasonably believes that the services are being used in violation of the Agreement; (ii) you don’t cooperate
        with our reasonable investigation of any suspected violation of the Agreement; (iii) there is an attack on the
        services or your services are accessed or manipulated by a third party without your consent, (iv) MailPace is
        required by law or by a regulatory or government body to suspend the services, or (v) there is another event for
        which MailPace reasonably believes that the suspension of the services is necessary to protect the MailPace
        network or our other customers. You agree that if the services are reinstated after a suspension for non-payment
        or for your breach of the Agreement (including the AUP), you will pay a reinstatement fee of $100.</p>

      <h3 class="my-2 text-2xl">4. Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
