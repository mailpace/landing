      <p class="mb-4">
        When you first sign up for OhMySMTP, we'll take you through a simple
        Onboarding process. Four easy steps:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-decimal">
        <li>
          <strong>Setup an organization</strong> - a group of domain names you
          can send from. It means you can separate your different services or
          companies that have multiple domains or logins to the dashboard
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enter your first domain</strong> - provide a URL and give it a
          name
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify your domain</strong> - instructions for verifying your
          domain over DKIM. This is vital to prove ownership of your domain,
          increase deliverability and prevent spam
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose a plan</strong> - pick the right plan for your
          Organization
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-16 mb-4">Sending your first email</h2>

        such as Ruby, Python, Go, PHP, and even include examples for sending
        direct from the command line using Curl

      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-16 mb-4">Tracking your emails</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Emails sometimes hard or soft-bounce, and some can even be marked as
        Spam by our outgoing spam filter. We provide an easy to use dashboard to
        see a summary of your sent emails. You can search for individual emails,
        see their status and drill down on them. We store 30-days of email
        history
