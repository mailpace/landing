Weâ€™re pleased to announce that all MailPace email and application data now resides inside the European Union.

The decision to migrate data over the channel has been a long requested feature of MailPace, with many customers requesting that their data be stored within the EU from the outset. Unfortunately, with the UK no longer in the EU after Brexit completed in 2020, many European companies are unhappy with their data being stored in the UK - a position we fully sympathise with.

We are genuinely committed to our customers and their user's privacy, and operate on a principle of storing and retaining the least amount of data available to run our service. We see this move as another step that makes us a stronger and more resilient organization. If you'd like to learn more about our Privacy approaches, you can review our Privacy Policy here: https://mailpace.com/privacy

Note that we retain some SMTP servers for processing outbound and inbound email within the UK, however no data is held on these servers.

If you have any questions or feedback about this change, please reach out to support@mailpace.com
