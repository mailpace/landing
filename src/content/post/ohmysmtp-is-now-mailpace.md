excerpt: We're renaming our service from OhMySMTP to MailPace!
category: Changelog
---

We're pleased to announce that as of today **OhMySMTP will be known as MailPace**.

Our original name was just a working name that stuck. As the service has grown and matured we wanted a name which was easier to understand for non-technical users and faster to pronounce (six syllables is quite the mouthful).

The final straw came when someone assumed we were a toilet paper company.

## What does this mean for you?

The good news is that **nothing changes for applications using OhMySMTP**.

All API routes and SMTP servers will remain the same. Existing libraries will continue to be available and work indefinitely.

We have migrated our libraries over to the new Domain & GitHub Organization, and we recommend you update your apps to these new libraries to continue to receive updates. For more details check out [the migration guide](https://docs.mailpace.com/guide/moving_from_ohmysmtp).

## What does this mean for us?

This is a name change only, ownership, service and all other aspects of our original service remain the same.
